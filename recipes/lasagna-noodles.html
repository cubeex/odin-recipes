		<h1>Homemade Lasagna Noodles</h1>

		<p>Homemade lasagna noodles are easier to make than you think and you don't even need a pasta machine. And forget about blanching the sheets before baking — no precooking is required!</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Two and one fourth {2 1/4} of Italian-style tipo 00 flour, plus additional for dusting</li>
				<li>Three {3} large eggs</li>
				<li>One {1} pinch of salt</li>
				<li>One {1} tablespoon of water as needed</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface. Make a well in the center and crack in eggs; add salt. Gently beat eggs using a fork, incorporating surrounding flour, until mixture is runny. Bring remaining flour into the mixture using a bench scraper until dough forms a ball. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough feels too stiff.</li>
				<li>Knead dough with your hands by flattening, stretching it, and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes</li>
				<li>Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
				<li>Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Take one piece and flatten it a bit with your hands. Dust a work surface with flour and roll dough out using a rolling pin 5 to 6 times. Turn dough 45 degrees and roll out again, 5 to 6 times. Keep rolling and turning in the same way until dough is evenly very thin. When you hold up the dough, you should be able to see your fingers through it.</li>
				<li>Cut pasta dough into rectangular sheets to fit your baking dish using a pastry wheel or a knife. Transfer lasagna sheets to a floured kitchen towel and let air-dry for about 30 minutes before assembling.</li>
				<h4>Tips</h4>
					<p>If you want to pre-make the pasta, air-dry it overnight, dusting with more flour if it's still too wet. Once completely dry, it will become stiff. Store in a paper bag, and use within a couple of days.</p>
				<h4>Pasta Machine Option:</h4>
					<p>Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Flatten 1 portion and pass through the thickest setting of the machine. Dust with flour, fold in half like a book, and repeat 3 to 4 times — always flouring, folding, and passing through the thickest setting — until dough is smooth in texture, even in size, and no longer sticky. Set the machine to a middle setting and pass each sheet through once more. Move to the next-to-last setting and pass through again. Cut 1 long strip in half. Pass the first half through the thinnest setting. Place this very long and thin sheet on a floured cloth. Repeat with remaining dough to make 6 long sheets. Trim sheets to fit your baking dish. Air-dry for 30 minutes, assemble, and bake.</p>
